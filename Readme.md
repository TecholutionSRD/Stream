# AI Hand Vision System

A computer vision system built on top of the Robotic AI Toolkit (RAIT) for object detection and 3D coordinate mapping using RealSense cameras and Google's Gemini model.

## Overview

This project implements a vision system that:
- Captures RGB and depth frames from RealSense D435i cameras
- Detects objects using Google's Gemini vision model
- Converts 2D pixel coordinates to 3D real-world coordinates
- Transforms coordinates between camera and robot base frames
- Records and saves video streams with synchronized RGB and depth data

## Installation

To set up the AI Hand Vision System, follow these steps:

<!-- 1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-hand-vision-system.git
    cd ai-hand-vision-system
    ``` -->
<!-- 
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Connect the RealSense D435i cameras to your system. -->

## Usage

To run the vision system, execute the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```
